# "Safelight" certificate, so the permission carries over. Its key is backed up in
# ~/.config/safelight/code-signing.p12 and kept in safelight-signing.keychain-db, a keychain with
# no password that the scheme's build pre-action unlocks, so codesign never stops to ask for one.
# Without it, the build is signed ad hoc, which names this one build alone: anyone else's copy
# works, but a release signed so would lose the permission at every update.
