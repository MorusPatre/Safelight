// screenshots leaves the color filter, brightness and appearance as they were.
// scripts/screenshots.sh checks the built app has no way left to call the system's.

/// Safelight loads MediaAccessibility (the color filter), DisplayServices (brightness), CoreDisplay
/// (which displays it dims under a dark layer) and SkyLight (the appearance) this way; with none of
/// them, it can neither read nor change any of those settings, lays no dark layer over a display, and
/// shows whatever the screenshot app sets it to.
