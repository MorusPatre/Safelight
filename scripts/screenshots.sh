# Draws the README's screenshots from the current code: the popover, open under its icon in the menu
# bar, and the Schedule window, in Dark and in Light. scripts/release.sh runs it too, so each release's
# screenshots match it.
#
#   scripts/screenshots.sh    writes docs/popover-dark.png, popover-light.png, schedule-dark.png and
#                             schedule-light.png
#
# It builds a copy of Safelight.swift into "Safelight Screenshots.app" with scripts/screenshots/,
# whose NoSystemChanges.swift stands in for the functions that change the color filter, brightness and
# appearance, so the Mac is left as it was. The copy has settings of its own, so the Schedule shows the
# default schedule rather than yours, and FixedTime.swift keeps it at 21:00. Beside its icon, the menu
# bar has stand-ins for Wi-Fi, Spotlight, Control Center and the clock rather than your own items. A
# screenshot that looks the same as the one in docs/ leaves it be, so they only change when the app
# does. Its windows are on screen for a few seconds, on a Retina display: leave them be until it's done.
